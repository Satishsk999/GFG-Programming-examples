Problem Statement : Given a string and a number N, we need to mirror the characters from the N-th position to the end of the string in alphabetical order. In a mirror operation:

'a' becomes 'z'
'b' becomes 'y'
'c' becomes 'x', and so on.
Examples:

Input: N = 3, word = paradox
Output: paizwlc

Approaches:
The mirror value of 'a' is 'z', 'b' is 'y', etc.
Create a dictionary mapping each character to its mirror value.
Traverse characters from position N to the end of the string and replace them using the dictionary.
Concatenate the unchanged prefix (first N-1 characters) with the mirrored part.

    prefix = input[0:k - 1]
    suffix = input[k - 1:]
    mirror = ''

    for i in range(0, len(suffix)):
        mirror = mirror + dictChars[suffix[i]]
    print(prefix + mirror)
